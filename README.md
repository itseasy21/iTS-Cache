# iTS-Cache
This class can be used to cache the output of PHP generated pages in files. 
It can capture the output of a PHP script section and cache it by storing the output in files.  
The output data is cached for a given timeout period. While the cache does not expire, the data is retrieved from the cache file.  
The cache file path and the timeout period are configurable.
